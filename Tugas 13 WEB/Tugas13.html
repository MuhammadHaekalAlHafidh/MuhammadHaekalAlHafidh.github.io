            <p>Avenged Sevenfold was known for the metalcore genre on their debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, 
               which contains lots of scream vocals. The band changed their style on their third album, City of Evil, 
               featuring melodic vocals and power ballads. The band continued to explore new sounds with the release titled Avenged Sevenfold
               and enjoyed success before dying of heart disease due to the combined effects of drugs and alcohol on his body in 2009.</p>

            <p>Shadows, like the other members of Avenged Sevenfold, uses a stage name. In an interview, 
               Shadows says that he chose his stage name because he thought of himself as "the darker character in the group".</p>

            <p>Synyster Gater entered the band Avenged Sevenfold as a guitarist when he was 18 years old in late 1999. 
                He also played piano on the songs "Beast and the Harlot" and "Sidewinder". He composed his first song titled "So Far Away" 
                in memory of his friend and drummer for Avenged Sevenfold.</p>

        <div id="Zacky" class="w3-container kota w3-animate-zoom w3-padding-16" style="display:none">
            <img src="zacky.jpg" width="40%">
            <p>Zacky said that before he entered Avenged Sevenfold, he had been a member of a punk rock band 
                called MPA which failed to achieve success. So Zacky and M. Shadows formed Avenged Sevenfold.</p>
